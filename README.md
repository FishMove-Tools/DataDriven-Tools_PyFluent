## Modification log
The toolkit was created by Zhan Ruixin, Georgia Institute of Technology and Sun Weiyuan, TsingHua University.  
This toolkit can train the control of robot fish agent in different flow environments, with less resource consumption compared with CFD.  
We plan to perform pre-training in a fast simulation environment（Gym and train by PPO） and plug the obtained strategies into CFD for further training to reduce the training time.  
Undoubtedly, the results are remarkable！  


## 📝 TODO List
- \[x\] Release Release policy fine-tuning part with pyfluent interface.
- \[ \] Release pre-training code.
- \[ \] Release the PD-FS framework.
- \[ \] Release the paper with demos.
